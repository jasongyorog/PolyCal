This is a colorful, text-based calendar widget for Android.

The color coding is intended to be especially useful for people who must
coordinate multiple calendars.

It is relatively simple, at least by Android project standards, and attempts
to use the standard practices for each part. By default, it has no calendar
permissions, and so it will be in "screenshot mode" (which was also used to
prepare the app widget preview).
